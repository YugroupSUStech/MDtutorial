## 1. 在模拟小环肽时的输出文件中出现 `TEMP(K) = NaN`， 模拟仍继续进行但很缓慢？

可能是因为模拟的体系太小，由于使用了`SHAKE`算法 (ntc=2) ，在使用cuda时会出现GPU无法处理的问题，原因如下：

This issue - a water shoots off to infinity can happen if your box is too small for the GPU code. The way the list is built if any edge of the box is less than 2 x (cutoff+skinnb) at any point during the simulation it causes a failure in the list build and the net result is often an atom ends up with nan's as its coordinates - in the case of a water with shake it drags the other atoms with it. 

可尝试使用较小的`cut`值，小于溶剂化时的`cutoff`，详见[[AMBER] Etot and TEMP become NaN during a simulation on commodity GPUs](http://archive.ambermd.org/201709/0165.html)。
